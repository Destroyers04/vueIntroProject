# vueintroproject

In this Vue project, I learned the basics and functionalities of Vue.js by following this crash course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeNfHj6MhgA. The project features components, reactive data, Vue Router, form handling, and API integration through a job board application. I implemented features like job listings, job details pages, and a job submission form.
